icon-resize
===========

Aiding iOS themers and developers in resizing their icons to work with iOS/Winterboard

# Usage
Using `icon-resize` is fairly simple. You can either run through python:
```
python icon-resize.py
```
or by double clicking the icon-resize.exe located in the exe folder (Linux and mac-friendly versions pending.)

You will be prompted with a dialog to select an image to use as the default image. Non-square images will automatically be cropped as close to the center as possible to fit a 1x1 ratio. Afterwards, you have the choice to use a folder of pre-existing .PNG icons to overwrite with resized versions of your own (handy for Icon Thief users), or simply do it manually.

Note: files will be overwritten without confirmation. Use at your own risk.
